Welcome to the "Sarjura" organization on GitHub!, child of '[@WeDontTrack](https://github.com/orgs/wedonttrack)' Organization. We are dedicated to developing applications that prioritize user privacy and data protection. 

## How and Why this Org..

Separation of concern for our first project so that we can decide whether to keep each code base separate or can we create a common code sample/modules.

## About Us

Just a couple of people [@vijay2249](https://github.com/vijay2249) & [@iredith](https://github.com/iredith) working on problems irritating us in our daily life.

Problems: Data collection and Ads popping up.

Principles of the development process:

- **Privacy First:** We don't collect or sell your personal information.
- **Open Source:** We believe in transparency and encourage collaboration.
- **User Empowerment:** Our software puts you in control of your data and digital experiences.

## Projects

###  GASto

A Simple expenses tracker application that is still in development phases with all the functionality needed without any ads and no data storing.
